Errors/Fixes:
1. missing <!DOCTYPE html> to start: add <!DOCTYPE html> before line 1
2. line 4 should be line two after an included <!DOCTYPE html>: it sould be on line two then and language should just be lang
3. no closing head tag: line 7 needs </head>
4. line 9 needed a closing </h1> tag
5. line 11 needed an opening <p> tag
6. line 13 changed from <ol> to <ul>
7. line 26 needed a closing </p> tag
8. line 28 needed an alt tag for the image: alt = "Meme1" was added
9. line 30 had a closing </img> tag, however it was not an img and <img> is an empty tag, so it was deleted
10. line 30 needed a closing </a> tag
11. line 39 closed with an opening <td> tag so a closing </td> was added in its place
12. line 45 needed a closing </table> tag
13. line 47 had source and needed to be changed to src
14. line 49 has an opening center and closing center tag which are obsolete elements without CSS, so they were deleted and replaced with <p></p> tags as placeholders
15. line 51 opened with a <p so an > was added to close that tag
16. line 55 was an unclosed comment, so -- > was added to close it (the space here (-- >) is just so my comment does not close; in the code there is no space)
17. line 57 was missing a closing </a> tag
18. line 59 had the </em> improperly nested, so it was switched inside the closing </p> tag
19. line 62 used <li> </li> tags nested within a <dl> </dl> tags, which is not allowed. They were replaced with <dt> and </dt> tags respectively
20. line 63 used <li> </li> tags nested within a <dl> </dl> tags, which is not allowed. They were replaced with <dd> and </dd> tags respectively
