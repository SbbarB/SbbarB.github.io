My name is Brett Rabbiner, and my pronouns are he/him. I like to stay active, and find myself outside quite a bit, whether that means climbing, skiing, running, hiking, or some other outdoor activity. As far as Web is concerned, I am hoping to both become a better programmer, as well as to learn how to build websites.
